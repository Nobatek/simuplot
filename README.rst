Simuplot
********

Simuplot is a post-processor and plotter for building thermal simulation results.


Features
========

- Simulator-agnostic (currently only Energy+ is supported)
- Copy plots into clipboad to paste in reports
- Extendable: other simulators or post-processors can be added


Requirements
============

Python >= 3.5, PyQt5, numpy, matplotlib


Installation
============

Either as root or in a Python3 virtual environment:
::

    $ pip install qbirthday

Note: If running with the global Python interpreter (i.e. not in a virtualenv), the default Python interpreter is probably Python2. In this case, you may have to install and use `pip3` rather than `pip`. Virtual environments are highly recommended anyway.


History
=======

Simuplot was developped in the STD+ project.
